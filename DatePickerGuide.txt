The datepicker control can show the date in the specified date format.

For the designed date picker control, the date format has been placed in App.config. 

The watermark for the datepicker would show according to the format. 

On click of submit button, the view model property value is displayed.

The SetDateFormat() in DatePickerClass sets the date format on load of the control. The date format would be uniform throught the application.
